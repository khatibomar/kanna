# NOTICE
the app is not available for public usage, because it needs secret keys in order to run. It's working and I am using it as my main anime watcher, so feel free to learn from the source code.
But I see it necessary to have credits at least for now so thanks to https://github.com/darylhjd/mangadesk I took lot of code from there with modification and added more stuff to fit my needs.
