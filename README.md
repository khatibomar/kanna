kanna is an cli app to watch Arabic anime

the app doesn't have a proper documentation yet waiting to continue working on that project once I am free from university projects. But I see it necessary to have credits at least for now so thanks to
https://github.com/darylhjd/mangadesk I took lot of code from there with modification and added more stuff to fit my needs.
